    <h3>HI, this is a web page that took way too much time to build.</h3>
<br>
    <h4>Here is some fun facts about Titanic!</h4>
    <h5>And what is think about them?</h5>
    <p>The Titanic was never actually described as "unsinkable". I feel they had a good lawyer </p>
    <p>The Titanic had a swimming pool on board! very cool for 1909</p>
    <p>There were 3 dogs on board, and they all survived. I consider it a happy ending </p>
    <p>There was a ship called the Titanic II, but it never sailed! understandable </p>
    <p>A third-class ticket at Titanic cost $40, which is approximately $900 in todayâ€™s currency. too much to die in the end!</p>
    <br>
    <h2>I have been seen {{ count }} times.</h2>
